# Skor

`skor` is a utility for Postgres which calls a webhook with row changes as JSON whenever an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE event occurs on a particular table. 
You can drop the docker image next to your Postgres database instance and configure a webhook that will be called whenever 
It comprises of a PostgcreSQL trigger function and the C program `skor` that listens to database notifications and invokes the webhook with a JSON payload.

## When to use
+ When you want to trigger an action in an external application when a table row is modified.
+ When you want a lightweight notification system for changes in the database.
+ When you want to send the changes to a message queue such as AMQP, Kafka etc.

## How it works
A PostgreSQL stored procedure is set up as a trigger on the required table(s). This trigger uses PostgreSQL's LISTEN and NOTIFY to publish change events as JSON to a notification channel. `Skor` watches this channel for messages and when a message is received, it makes an HTTP POST call to the webhook with the JSON payload. The webhook can then decide to take an action on this.

## Caveats
+ Events are only captured when skor is running.
+ If a call to the webhook fails, it is **not** retried.

## Getting started

### 1) Set up the trigger:

Use the `init.sh` script to setup triggers on the tables for which you want change notifications:

```bash
$ ./init.sh table1 table2 | psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres --
```

### 2) Run Skor:

Run the skor Docker image (that has the `skor` binary baked in):

```bash
$ docker run \
    -e DBNAME="postgres" \
    -e PGUSER="postgres" \
    -e PGPASS="''" \
    -e PGHOST="localhost" \
    -e PGPORT=5432 \
    -e WEBHOOKURL="http://localhost:5000/" \
    --net host \
    -it hasura/skor:v0.1.1
```

Make sure you use the appropriate database parameters and webhook URL above.

## Examples

### INSERT

Query:
```sql
INSERT INTO test_table(name) VALUES ('abc1');
```

JSON webhook payload:

```json
{"data": {"id": 1, "name": "abc1"}, "table": "test_table", "op": "INSERT"}
```

### UPDATE

Query:
```sql
UPDATE test_table SET name = 'pqr1' WHERE id = 1;
```

JSON webhook payload:

```json
{"data": {"id": 1, "name": "pqr1"}, "table": "test_table", "op": "UPDATE"}
```

### DELETE

Query:
```sql
DELETE FROM test_table WHERE id = 1;
```

JSON webhook payload:

```json
{"data": {"id": 1, "name": "pqr1"}, "table": "test_table", "op": "DELETE"}
```

## Deploying Skor on Hasura

The pre-built Docker image with the `skor` binary is available at `hasura/skor` and can be deployed as a microservice with the sample `k8s.yaml` in this repo.
The webhook can be another microservice that exposes an endpoint.

To learn more on deploying microservices on Hasura you may check out the [documentation](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/microservices/index.html).


## Build Skor:

### Requirements:

+ PostgreSQL 9+
+ `gcc` 
+ libcurl (`libcurl4-openssl-dev`) 
+ libppq (`libpq-dev`)


### Build:

```bash
$ make
```
### Run:

```bash
$ ./build/skor 'host=localhost port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres password=' http://localhost:5000
```

## Test

The test runs `skor` and a python-flask server for the webhook. 

Make sure you have installed python-flask and have Postgres running on `localhost:5432` before running the test.
You can modify the Postgres credentials in the `test.py` file.

Run the test (present in the root directory) as:

```bash
$ python test.py
```
